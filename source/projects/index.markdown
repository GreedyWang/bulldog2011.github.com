Below are a list of open source projects I maintained on GitHub:
  
1. [bigqueue](https://github.com/bulldog2011/bigqueue) - a super fast, big and persistent queue implemented in Java.
2. [nano](https://github.com/bulldog2011/nano) - a super light xml and json binding framework suppoting both Java and Android platform.
