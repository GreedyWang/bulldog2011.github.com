I am a software developer and architect living in Shanghai China, 
I am facinated with simple while elegant programming abstractions.
I like to program and write stuff, making things a reality always make me excited.

I love open source and I spend most of spare time studying and contributing to it, 
my favoriate sites are github, stackoverflow and google.

My dream is to escape the company cube someday, and to work on startups or projects I am interested with,
to have a leasurely and carefree life style, to have more time with my family and bulldog.
